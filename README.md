# NYC-Math-Exam-Performance

The purpose of this project is to analyze the performance on New York State-mandated mathematics assessments from 2013-2023 within New York City (NYC) to better understand the factors that contribute to varying levels of academic achievement in primary schools among NYC Department of Education (DOE) districts. Notably, we are observing the effects of the NYSED's adoption of the Common Core standards on the education system.

We will define three performance tiers—Below Standards, Approaching Standards, and Meeting/Exceeding Standards—and will create a classification model to identify the key socioeconomic features that distinguish these groups. Rather than using a supervised learning model to predict data we already have, we found it more worthwhile to explore the underlying correlations and associations between these tiers and various factors. As students of the Baruch College Mathematics Department, we understand the importance of early mathematical maturity and have decided to focus on the math portion of the state-mandated exams rather than the ELA portion.

Our inputs for this project will be the proportion of English Language Learner (ELL) students, the proportion of Students with Disabilities (SWD), the proportion of economically disadvantaged students, and the regional district. The output will be the performance tiers mentioned above, which are formulated from the DOE's [1,2,3,4] grading level system.

The ultimate goal is to obtain information that can inform public policy, guide internal resource allocation, and emphasize the importance of individual to societal success.
